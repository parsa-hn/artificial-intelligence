A series of five projects. Gained knowledge on fundamental subjects of AI, such as search and genetic algorithms. Also, more contemporary areas such as ML, NLP, and neural networks were part of this course. We used regression methods to predict housing prices, performed text classification on Persian comments, implemented a full neural network and used Tensorflow and Keras for image classification.
